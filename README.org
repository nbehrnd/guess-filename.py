* guessfilename.py

This Python script tries to come up with a new file name for each
file from command line argument.

It does this with several methods: first, the current file name is
analyzed and any [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iso_date][ISO date/timestamp]] and [[https://github.com/novoid/filetags/][filetags]] are re-used.
Secondly, if the parsing of the file name did not lead to any new file
name, the content of the file is analyzed. Following file types are
supported by now:
- PDF files

The script accepts an arbitrary number of files (see your shell for
possible length limitations).

- *Target group*: users who are able to use command line tools and who
  are using tags in file names.
- Hosted on github: https://github.com/novoid/guess-filename.py

** Why

I do scan almost all paper mail. Many of those documents are sent to
me regularily. Such documents are bills or insurance informations, for
example.

Being too lazy to name those files manually with high chances of
getting many variants for the same document type, I came up with a
method to derive file names from either the old file name (cues I
enter without knowing the exact target file name) or the file content.

Analyzing the content enables this script to recognize bills via
customer numbers or phone numbers, amounts to pay, and so on.

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :wrap src
./guessfilename/__init__.py --help
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_src
Usage:
    guessfilename [<options>] <list of files>

This little Python script tries to rename files according to pre-defined rules.

It does this with several methods: first, the current file name is analyzed and
any ISO date/timestamp and filetags are re-used. Secondly, if the parsing of the
file name did not lead to any new file name, the content of the file is analyzed.

You have to adapt the rules in the Python script to meet your requirements.
The default rule-set follows the filename convention described on

* Related tools and workflows

This tool is part of a tool-set which I use to manage my digital files
such as photographs. My work-flows are described in [[http://karl-voit.at/managing-digital-photographs/][this blog posting]]
you might like to read.

In short:

For *tagging*, please refer to [[https://github.com/novoid/filetags][filetags]] and its documentation.

See [[https://github.com/novoid/date2name][date2name]] for easily adding ISO *time-stamps or date-stamps* to
files.

For *easily naming and tagging* files within file browsers that allow
integration of external tools, see [[https://github.com/novoid/appendfilename][appendfilename]] (once more) and
[[https://github.com/novoid/filetags][filetags]].

Moving to the archive folders is done using [[https://github.com/novoid/move2archive][move2archive]].

Having tagged photographs gives you many advantages. For example, I
automatically [[https://github.com/novoid/set_desktop_background_according_to_season][choose my *desktop background image* according to the
current season]].

Files containing an ISO time/date-stamp gets indexed by the
filename-module of [[https://github.com/novoid/Memacs][Memacs]].

-------------

[[http://www.jonasjberg.com/][Jonas Sj√∂berg]] took my idea and developed the much more advanced (and
thus a bit more complicated) [[https://github.com/jonasjberg/autonameow][autonameow]]. It uses rule-based renaming,
analyzes content of plain text, epub, pdf and rtf files, extracts
meta-data from many different file formats via [[https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/%257Ephil/exiftool/][exiftool]] and so forth.
